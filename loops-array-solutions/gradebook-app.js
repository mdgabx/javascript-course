Build a Gradebook App

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

    You should have a function named getAverage that takes an array of test scores as a parameter and returns the average score.

    You should have a function named getGrade that takes a student score as a parameter and returns a string representing a letter grade based on the score. Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:
    Score Range 	Grade
    100 	"A+"
    90 - 99 	"A"
    80 - 89 	"B"
    70 - 79 	"C"
    60 - 69 	"D"
    0 - 59 	"F"

    You should have a function named hasPassingGrade that takes a score as a parameter and returns either true or false depending on if the score corresponds to a passing grade.

    The hasPassingGrade function should use the getGrade function to get the letter grade, and use it to determine if the grade is passing. A passing grade is anything different from "F".

    You should have a function named studentMsg that takes an array of scores and a student score as the parameters. The function should return a string with the format:
        "Class average: average-goes-here. Your grade: grade-goes-here. You passed the course.", if the student passed the course.
        "Class average: average-goes-here. Your grade: grade-goes-here. You failed the course.", if the student failed the course.

    Replace average-goes-here with the average of total scores and grade-goes-here with the student's grade. Use getAverage to get the average score and getGrade to get the student's grade.
